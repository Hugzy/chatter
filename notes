Goal:
Create a set of endpoints that allows for registering a user, logging in, and logging out.

registerng a user means putting creating an entry in the database.
logging in means validating the users login and creating an accesskey, 
persisting it for some time and deleting it. The accesskey should be returned to the client
logging out means invalidating the users accesskey in the acceskey table


- Add validate login to all paths registered
- Enable login cookie
- Enable logout clearing of cookie
