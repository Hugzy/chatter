Goal:
Create a set of endpoints that allows for registering a user, logging in, and logging out.

* switch out database driver with https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx, http://go-database-sql.org/accessing.html - DONE
* registerng a user means putting creating an entry in the database.
* logging in means validating the users login and creating an accesskey, 
* persisting it for some time and deleting it. The accesskey should be returned to the client
* logging out means invalidating the users accesskey in the acceskey table


- Add validate login to all paths registered
- Enable login cookie
- Enable logout clearing of cookie
 
test cases:
* create a user, check if the username exists in the database
* login, check if password match with seeded user
* logout, check if accesskey exists in login table
